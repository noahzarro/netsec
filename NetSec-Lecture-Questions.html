Please ask your questions directly in Zoom after raising your hand or post them in the Zoom chat.</strong></span><br></p><h2>Lecture 7 (2020-10-27)<br></h2><ul><li><p>Why are ToR packets easily identified when looking at encrypted network traffic? Isn’t all the ToR specific payload contained in the encrypted payload of IP packets?<br></p><ul><li><p>The boring answer is: by looking at the IP destination, if that IP address is a known entry guard. I also believe that TOR packets may, to a statistical analysis, look very much unlike normal traffic (in particular, the circuit estabishing part). We also know that TOR uses a custom protocol, and by packet inspection it may be possible to distinguish some of the TOR headers. <em>(Also answered during lecture at slide 55)</em><br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Is this telescopic setup build upon another protocol such as TLS or is Tor using its own protocol? Because it looks like its between L3 and L4.<br></p><ul><li><p>It's a custom KEX (Key Exchange protocol). It builds upon IP, so definitively L4.<br></p></li><li><p>A personal comment: I see no reason for TOR not to use TLS between circuits, if not header size.<br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>How is the connection between Bob and C1 (or OR2 here? Slide 51) secured or is it one way only from Alice to Bob?<br></p><ul><li><p>The last hop of communication is normal IP, and not protected in any way. Think about TOR as a network layer: TOR anonymizes your source IP. It is up to Alice, now, to setup real end-to-end encryption, e.g. by using TLS to communicate with Bob.<br></p></li><li><p>Thanks for the great answer!</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Is there anything preventing the end-server that we connect to from fingerprinting our end-to-end TLS connection and be able to more or less identifiable anyhow? (Let's assume we aren't using the TOR browser which does some of this.) Is there even a way to do this? Seperate browser only used for TOR?<br></p><ul><li><p>In short: no, the end server can fingerprint our browser. The solution is to use the standard TOR Browser <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">https://www.torproject.org/download/</a><br>or a separate virtual machine/OS dedicated to TOR (e.g. Whoonix or Tails, but the latter  also uses the TOR Browser)<br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>What is the difference between Direct circuit setup and the TOR circuit creation? (It looks the same for me)<br></p><ul><li><p>The TOR setup is telescopic: in a direct setup, the establishment of the circuit happens in a signle RTT, and uses the long term keys of all the circuit nodes involved (the client has no other cryptographic material established with the nodes).<br>In a telescopic setup, instead, the circuit itself is forward secret: information about the second node is  encrypted with an ephemeral key established with the first node during (and so on for all the nodes in the circuit).<br></p></li><li><p>Thank you :)<br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>So for the realy_early DoS protection we rely on the first circuit node to be trustworthy in counting the number if extend request correctly, right? Otherwise it could just report a lower count. This only extends the path by the number of malicious nodes used in the beginning of the circuit.<br></p><ul><li><p>Any node can do this check (not just the first), and any node that does not do this check will be part on the path of the attack, and is therefore incentivized to do it.<em> (Also answered during lecture at&nbsp; slide 56)</em><br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>So does an hidden service provider need to register its service at the Introduction Points [IP]? One? Or all? Do IPs communicate registered services?<br></p><ul><li><p>The hidden (onion) service provider registers to a small set of Introduction Points. When resolving an onion address, a client will use a Distributed Hash Table (DHT, also use in bittorrent to exchange nodes) to get information on how to setup a circuit to the hidden service.<br></p></li><li><p>A more complete explanation: <a data-cke-saved-href="https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/overview/" href="https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/overview/">https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/overview/</a><br></p></li><li><p>(Hope this answers both questions)<br></p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Exercise 6 (2020-10-22)<br></h2><ul><li>Can everyone attend the question hour, or is it one-to-one for those who asked questions beforehand? If everyone can attend, what would be the zoom link for the meeting?<br><ul><li>The question hour seems to be taking place in the lecture hall today.<br></li><li>It's by Zoom, but as usual we stick around after exercise sessions to answer questions.<br></li><li>But there is no collective zoom meeting to discuss questions, right? Only one-to-one meetings for those who posted on GitLab?<br><ul><li>Yes. If there is request for it, we can do a collective zoom meeting.<br></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Hi, I posted a private question for the question hour, but only an hour ago. Would it still be possible to get a zoom session with an assistant?<br><ul><li>Sure. Hang on.<br></li><li>Ok, thanks<br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Lecture 6 (2020-10-20)<br></h2><ul><li>What happens in DH(E<sub>I</sub>, S<sub>R</sub>)?<br><ul><li>We make a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between the client's and the server's ephemeral keypair.<br></li><li>[ML] I will add some details to the corresponding slide. <br>Take private keys x and y; then x^{pub} = g^x and y^{pub}=g^y and DH(x, y) = (x^{pub})^y = (y^{pub})^x = g^{xy}.<br></li></ul></li><li>Shouldn't S_R in the DH calcuation for the MAC be S_R_Pub? Because this looks like the initiator has access to the private key of the responder.<br><ul><li>The shorthand notation indicates that we are using the private key we have access to and the public key of the other party, depending on who computes the DH share. (So yes, you are right: S_R denotes the public key of the server in this case).<br></li><li>[ML] See also details in previous question.<br></li></ul></li><li>In DSSS: How can a receiver know that there is a communcation starting?<br><ul><li>The receiver constantly listens while applying a "despreading code" to the signals it receives. The signal, once despread, will be the same as the original signal, and it is possible to see the communication start normally. (SOWN course cover this and similar topics in more detail)<br></li></ul></li><li>In the case of cascade of multiple proxies, could an adversary sitting on the links infer that Alice communicates with Bob based on the timing at which the packets are sent?<br><ul><li>Yes, those systems are vulnerable to statistical attacks (this includes TOR). Mix-nets try to make this kind of correlation harder.<br></li></ul></li><li>Is the cascade of multiple proxies similar to tor network?<br><ul><li>That is correct. Each of the proxy hops is similar to a layer of the "onion".<br></li></ul></li><li>Is there a zoom link? video.ethz.ch is really buggy and slow for me. If no, how do I access the recording?<br><ul><li>No, this lecture is only broadcast through ETH streaming. The recording can be accessed at <a data-cke-saved-href="https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-infk/2020/autumn/263-4640-00L.html" href="https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-infk/2020/autumn/263-4640-00L.html">https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-infk/2020/autumn/263-4640-00L.html</a><br></li><li>If there are more reports of video.ethz.ch being slow, we can probably report this.<br></li></ul></li><li>How is the ID of the next relay protected (slide 28)? How can TLS help us?<br><ul><li>I think slide 29 explains this, but if you have other questions I can try to answer them/relay them to Markus. TLS is used to implement the secure channel form the sender to each of the relays.<br></li></ul></li><li>Will exercice 4 solution be online soon? <br><ul><li>I did not notice it was missing, thank you for reporting this. I'll upload it soon.<br></li><li>many thanks<br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Exercise 5 (2020-10-15)<br></h2><h3>Guest Lecture<br></h3><ul><li>What's the zoom link? <a data-cke-saved-href="https://ethz.zoom.us/j/96794315694" href="https://ethz.zoom.us/j/96794315694">ahttps://ethz.zoom.us/j/96794315694</a> ​​​​​​​<br></li><li><p>Are there any simple but useful methods to hide your trace (such as ip, personal info) on the internet? Such as using a VPN.<br></p><ul><li><p>Stay tuned for the anonymous-communication lecture next week. :)</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Exercise Session<br></h3><ul><li>Is it possible to upload the slides for ex. sessions before the actual sessions so we can take notes on them? (If they are already on gitlab, could you tell me where?) Thanks!<br><ul><li>I'll ask Matteo. I personally don't want to do it to encourage participation. (i. e. people can't already see the solution)<br></li><li>It is very convenient to have all material for the class in one place (lecture+ex slides) instead of having notes all over the place. However, I completely understand your point :))<br></li></ul></li><li>Can the bank also simply stop accepting 0-RTT for requests chaning state, i.e. accept 0-RTT only for GET requests? This would not require anything complicated for keeping track of PSK-s.<br><ul><li>I believe that Cloudflare have implemented this way&nbsp;<br>"<a data-cke-saved-href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt/" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt/</a>"<br><strong>GET requests with no query parameters -&nbsp;</strong>but article from 2017...<br></li><li>Pretty dated, but I think still works<br></li><li>=&gt; Works in principle but not all applications have GET requests which don't change state. So it would have to be kept in mind for designing the bank application. (answered shortly after 17:45)<br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Lecture 5 (2020-10-13)<br></h2><p><em>(Questions during lecture)</em><br></p><em></em><ul><li><p>Chaining multiple VPN's would make it harder for a single VPN to know who you are unless they all communicate with eachother.<br></p><ul><li><p>That is correct.<br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>VPNs can be used to enable secure communication with legacy services which do not support TLS or other types of transport security.<br></p><ul><li><p>Yes, that would work!<br></p><ul><li><p>But the traffic between the VPN and the service would still not be encrypted, it only helps against an eavesdropper in our local network<br></p><ul><li><p>Also, it helps if the legacy service provider is the one who offers the VPN endpoint. Think about using ETH VPN to access some HTTP-only resource inside ETH's network.<br></p></li><li><p>[ML] Indeed, this always depends on your attacker model / expectations. If you can reasonably assume that there is no eavesdropper between the VPN endpoint and the legacy service, a VPN is a good mechanism to use.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Exercise 4 (2020-10-08)<br></h2><ul><li><p>No questions<br></p></li></ul><h2>Lecture 4 (2020-10-06)<br></h2><p><em>(Questions during lecture)</em><br></p><ul><li>So far we have always seen that diversity in encryption standards is a "bad" thing. But doesn't it also make it harder for attacker to attack a broader range of users if a vulnerability is discovered?<br><ul><li>If the cryptographic primitives used in TLS 1.3 are all deemed very unlikely to be broken -- if they are, TLS traffic could be the last of our problems. New primitives can be added if necessary, by publishing new versions of the standard (that also aggressively remove old, insecure cryptography).<br>Also note that breaks in modern cryptography tend to be gradual rather then explosive e.g. SHA-1: ~10 years from first attacks to full strong collision resistance violation (SHAttered). <br></li></ul></li><li>Does the "*" after clientCertificate (and other components of slide 48) mean anything in particular?<br><ul><li>They mean the message is optional (in slide 48, this is because client auth is optional).<br></li></ul></li><li>When using HTTPS: will there be a new TLS handshake for every GET request?<br><ul><li>No: the underlying TLS (and TCP) connection will stay alive. They will be closed, eventually, after a timeout.</li></ul></li><li>The key computed from DH (g^xy) is used to encrypt the handshake. Is that also the key used for the AEAD part? My understanding is that we use a new key for that. Is that key also established during the handshake?<ul><li>Slide 54 should answer this: a lot of different keys are derived in different parts of the handshake: in this case, the key used for AEAD are the client traffic key and the server traffic key, which are derived from CATS and SATS, which in turn are the result of a chain of HKDF evaluation that also takes the DH value as an input.<br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Exercise 3 (2020-10-01)<br></h2><h3><em></em>Guest Lecture<br></h3><ul><li><p>where are the exercise slides for the guest lecture? I cant find them on git<br></p><ul><li><p>They have been added to the GitLab repository in the meantime.<br></p></li></ul></li><li><p>during the process to assign ipv6 addresses, what happens if an attacker prevent another device that already uses the advertised adress from responding?<br></p><ul><li><p>Ok, so based on the question I just asked: IPv6 routers cache this kind of information for some time, until they detect the fact that the device is offline. (but I'm still not sure I fully understand your question<br></p></li></ul></li></ul><h3><em></em>Guest Lecture<br></h3><ul><li><em></em>Can we do other challenges or events besides the ETHZ network security one?<br><ul><li>On Hacking Lab, you can do any challenges you have access to. We won't provide you with access to additional challenges, but  there was an advent calender of challenges last year.<br></li><li>A shameless plug: ETH has a CTF team, flagbot. We play CTFs on weekends, both remotely and (now more rarely) at ETH. <a data-cke-saved-href="https://flagbot.ch/" href="https://flagbot.ch/">https://flagbot.ch/</a><br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Lecture 3 (2020-09-29)<br></h2><ul><li>Just curious, why is there a 10% decrease at the end of the line of windows (slide 5)?<br><ul><li>Some statistical variations on the stats are common, they can be caused by events such as changing the way traffic is measured/ integrating a new source of data. <em>(Answered only online)</em><br></li></ul></li><li>Is there any compatibility between QUIC (over UDP, but which is reliable) and TLS?<br><ul><li>TLS1.3 has a 0RTT resumption mode, and a TLS1.3-over-UDP protocol exists (DTLS), which is quite close to QUIC. In general, QUIC is not compatible with any TLS version, but the QUIC design influenced many TLS drafts, and most of the performance advantages originally brought by QUIC are today present in DTLS/TLS1.3. Moreover, the IETF version of QUIC now uses the same handshake as TLS1.3, but encapsulated in its own packet format. <em>(Also answered during explanation of slide 22/23)</em><br></li></ul></li><li>In the cipher-suite examples, SHA256 is mentionned. Do we talk about SHA1, SHA2 or SHA3 here?&nbsp; <br><ul><li>SHA&lt;bits no&gt; usually refers to SHA2. For SHA-3, you would use SHA-3-256. Also note that SHA1 is 160-bit only <em>(Answered only online)</em><br></li></ul></li><li>Slide 5 shows that google mail uses TLS at 100% for encryption of the mails. However, this is just encryption at the transport level, not end-to-end encryption, isn't it? Does it mean that on the google mail servers, the mails are not encrypted and they could still read your mail?<br><ul><li>That is correct, TLS only protects transport level. Emails in gmail are not e2e encrypted, and they are (or, at least, used to be, <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/26/google-will-stop-scanning-content-of-personal-emails" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/26/google-will-stop-scanning-content-of-personal-emails">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/26/google-will-stop-scanning-content-of-personal-emails</a>) used for targeted advertisement. <em>(Answered only online)</em><br></li><li>-&gt;&nbsp;But TLS at least encrypts the data "over the wire", right? But then the data is in plaintext on the email server?<br><ul><li>TLS protects client-to-server and (often) server-to-server communication, so yes, someone looking at your traffic won't be able to read your emails. Google is likely to also encrypt data at rest, but has access to all plaintext. Some secure email solutions encrypt user data with a key derived from the user password, so that only the user can decrypt them. <em>(Answered only online)</em><br></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What's a reflection attack?<br><ul><li>In short: when you get a TLS endpoint to establish a connection to itself. <em>(Answered only online)</em><br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Exercise 2 (2020-09-24)<br></h2><ul><li><p>No questions<br></p></li></ul><h2>Lecture 2 (2020-09-22)<br></h2><ul><li>Why do intermediate CA certificates suffice for doing MitM?<ul><li>The difference between root and intermediate is that root certificates are self-signed (and must be pre-installed to be trusted) whereas intermediate CAs are signed by another certificate with the authority to do so. Both kinds of certificates have the authority to issue new (non-CA) certificates and therefore suffice for MitM. <em>(Answered only online)</em><br></li></ul></li><li>Question about short lived certificates. Isn't another approach to attack the CA authority issuing new certificates such that their service is not reachable anymore? This would cause a website to not be able to renew its certificate. Resulting in an invalid certificate used for user requests.<br><ul><li>Good point, this is a point of concern. Fortunately, this attack isn't easy to do because the attacker would have to keep the attack on the CA up for a long time. Currently, short lived certificates are valid in the order of days and will be renewed some days in advance. <em>(Answered in the middle of second half, Let's Encrypt slide)</em><em></em><br></li></ul></li><li>what is the visual difference between domain validation and OV/High assurance? they look the same to me<br><ul><li>There are standards for these different validation levels. However, there are still differences between different CAs (OV and "High assurance" should be the same, the explanation was more about OV vs. EV)<em> (Answered shortly later, when on slide 32)</em><br></li></ul></li><li>If a CA is compromised, can the attacker just hand out EV certificates? If not, what prevents the attacker from doing that?<ul><li>Sometimes there are different entities which issue certificates of different levels (within the CA Organization). Potentially, the EV ones are better secured. <em>(Answered after the explanation of slide 33)</em><br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Exercise 1 (2020-09-17)<br></h2><ul><li>iBGP is uncommon for intra-domain routing?<br><ul><li>--&gt; Yes, it is uncommon. While BGP messages are present within the domain, they usually concern routing on the outside. There may still be applications of BGP but they aren't common, so the rule of thumb shown on the slides applies. <em>(Recorded answer is shortly before the break.) </em><br></li></ul></li><li>The question was about internal vs. external BGP (iBGP vs. eBGP). Is internal BGP uncommon for intra-domain routing?<br><ul><li>--&gt; This question requires a more detailed explanation, please open an issue on GitLab for it. Then Markus Legner will answer it there.​​​​​​​<br></li></ul></li><li>Related to the question above: Why are there different routing protocols used for internal vs external networks? (e.g. BGP for external vs OSPF for internal). Is it because in the internal case we know the exact topology and how the network is layed out in detail? (vs. kind of a blackbox in the external case?)<br><ul><li>--&gt; The protocols have different strengths. BGP is better equipped to deal with the policies between ASs. <em>(Recorded answer is directly after the break).</em><em></em><em></em><br></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Lecture 1 (2020-09-15)<br></h2><ul><li>Can lecture slides be made available ahead of time?<br><ul><li>--&gt; <a data-cke-saved-href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-resources/-/tree/master/lectures" href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-resources/-/tree/master/lectures">https://gitlab.inf</a><a data-cke-saved-href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-resources/-/tree/master/lectures" href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-resources/-/tree/master/lectures">.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-resources/-/tree/master/lectures</a><br></li></ul></li><li>Will the lecture on thursday be recorderd and or livestreamed?<br><ul><li>--&gt; yes, both.<br></li></ul></li><li>will the solutions be posted to each exercices, and if so when?<br><ul><li>--&gt; yes, on Thursday before the exercise session<br></li></ul></li><li>When will the registration link of hacking lab be distributed?<br><ul><li>In a few weeks, there will be an exercise session with more information on HackingLab.<br></li></ul></li><li>will there be other keyboard types different from US and DE?<br><ul><li>&nbsp;--&gt; No, the ETH Exam Center only provides CH (QWERTZ) and US (QWERTY) keyboards.
