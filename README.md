# Network Security (NetSec) 2020 User Manual

Welcome to the NetSec course! For this course, GitLab will serve as the main point of (online)
interaction between students and the course team. Concretely, using this GitLab you will

- receive lecture materials such as slides, exercises, and old exams;
- be able to ask question about lecture content, projects, administrative issues, ...;
- have the ability to hand in your exercise sheets and get feedback on them; and
- be able to apply for a _lecture ticket_, which will allow you to visit the lectures at ETH in
  person.

Each of these items are discussed in more detail below.

## Online Teaching

## Asking Questions

***Please do not send us questions by email.***

### Issue Tracker

If you want to ask a question about any aspect the course, please use the [issue
tracker](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-issues/-/issues).

If your question does not contain personal or sensitive information, we encourage you to make the
issue public. If you are uncomfortable with your question being visible to everyone, you can choose
to make your issue
[confidential](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html) by selecting
the checkbox on the new issue page. Confidential issues cannot be seen by other students.

If your question does contain personal or sensitive information, please mark the issue as
confidential.

### Question Hour

Because the question hour as we organized it last year resulted in many people standing close
together, we have decided to move the question hours fully online.

In order to make this work, the online question hours will have a different structure from more
classical, in-person question hours. Most significantly, you will not be able to ask spontaneous
questions during the question hour. Instead, we will follow the principle that **all questions must
first be asked through a [GitLab
issue](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-issues/-/issues)**. When we
notice that a question is too complex to properly answer via GitLab issues, we will reserve a slot
for this question during the next question hour. During the question hour each SA / TA / lecturer
will then answer questions via their own Zoom room, according to the prearranged schedule. You can
find an overview of all issues that will discussed during the next question hour
[here](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-issues/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=question-hour).

This has the following advantages:

- Less COVID-19
- Questions can be directly assigned to the most competent SA / TA / lecturer
- No need to stand in a queue during the question hour
- Questions with a simple answer can be quickly answered through the issue tracker
- If many students have the same or similar questions, we can bundle the discussion of this question
  in to one slot

Note that questions must be asked via the issue tracker at least one day ahead to be scheduled in a
question hour.

Of course, it remains possible to ask questions directly during the lectures or exercise sessions.

### During the Lecture or Exercise session

There are three options to ask questions during lectures exercise sessions:

1. (**preferred**) Raise your hand (virtually) on Zoom. After being prompted by the lecturer or assistant,
2. unmute yourself and ask the question verbally. If you want, you can also enable your camera (not required).
3. Ask your question in the Zoom chat.
4. Use the document at <https://course.netsec.inf.ethz.ch/questions> to ask anonymous questions.

An assistant will monitor the chat and the question document and selectively ask some of the questions verbally.

## Handing in Exercises

You can hand in exercises by creating a **confidential** issue with a title starting with
`[exercise-hand-in]`. You should use the filled in exercise template as the body of the issue.

## Hacking-Lab

You will have the chance to solve hands-on security challenges on [Hacking-Lab](https://academy.hacking-lab.com/)
during this course. Overall, there will be three sets of challenges related to (1) TLS, (2) DNS,
and (3) firewalls. Hacking-Lab is completely optional and has no influence on your grade.

### Timeline

The challenges will be opened on the day of the respective lecture in "wargame" mode (i.e., without
any hints) and will be switched to "tutorial" mode (with hints but reduced points) one week later.
They will remain open for at least the whole semester. We may show some of the challenges and
explain background information during the exercise sessions.

The dates for the three categories are as follows:

- **TLS**: Open on 06.10.2020 at 00:00, enable hints on 13.10.2020 at 08:00
- **DNS**: Open on 10.11.2020 at 00:00, enable hints on 17.11.2020 at 08:00
- **Firewalls**: Open on 17.11.2020 at 00:00, enable hints on 24.11.2020 at 08:00
