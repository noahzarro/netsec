Dear students,

In my previous e-mail, I wrote that not doing the project will result in a maximum grade of 5.0 for the course. This maximum grade is relevant for the case where you do not do either of the two course projects (the ACME project AND a project that will follow later in the semester). In case you do just one of the two project, the maximum grade achievable is 5.5.

Sorry for any provoked misunderstandings!

Best regards,

Simon
Project TA
