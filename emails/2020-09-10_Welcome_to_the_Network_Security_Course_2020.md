[Network Security] Welcome to the Network Security Course 2020

Dear students

An unusual autumn semester at ETH Zurich is about to start next week. Despite the difficult situation due to COVID-19, we are excited to begin the Network Security course on Tuesday (September 15). You will hear about exciting current and future developments as well as fundamental concepts of network security. In addition, six distinguished guest lecturers will provide insights into how network security is applied in the real world. Besides extending a general welcome, we would like to provide some essential information in this email.

Please visit the lecture website [1] which provides all important information about the course and links to further resources. I will highlight the most important points in the following:

* We will (ab-)use the department's GitLab instance [2] for most course-related resources and communication. Unfortunately managing access control to GitLab still involves a manual step. Therefore it might take a couple of days after signing up for the course before you get access. Please only contact us by email if you are not able to access the GitLab repository three days after officially registering for the course.
* Due to COVID-19 restrictions, only a limited number of students will be allowed to attend the lecture in person. We have implemented a ticketing system; the details are described on the website.
* All lectures and exercise classes will be both live-streamed and recorded.
* Please note that you need to wear a face mask whenever attending classes in person. Lecturers will wear face masks or face shields.

We are looking forward to interacting with you either in person or digitally over the coming months. All the best and stay healthy!

For the whole Network Security teaching team
Adrian Perrig, Stefan Frei, and Markus Legner
