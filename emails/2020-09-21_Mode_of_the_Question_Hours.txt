[Network Security] Mode of the Question Hours

Dear Students

Because the question hour as we organized it last year resulted in many people standing close together, we have decided to move the question hours fully online.

In order to make this work, the online question hours will have a different structure from more classical, in-person question hours. Most significantly, you will not be able to ask spontaneous questions during the question hour. Instead, we will follow the principle that all questions must first be asked through a GitLab issue [1]. When we notice that a question is too complex to properly answer via GitLab issues, we will reserve a slot for this question during the next question hour. During the question hour each SA / TA / lecturer
will then answer questions via their own Zoom room, according to the prearranged schedule. You can find an overview of all issues that will discussed during the next question hour on the issue tracker [2].

This has the following advantages:
- Less COVID-19
- Questions can be directly assigned to the most competent SA / TA / lecturer
- No need to stand in a queue during the question hour
- Questions with a simple answer can be quickly answered through the issue tracker
- If many students have the same or similar questions, we can bundle the discussion of this question in to one slot

Note that questions must be asked via the issue tracker at least one day ahead to be scheduled in a question hour.

Of course, it remains possible to ask questions directly during the lectures or exercise sessions.

Kind regards
Piet, NetSec Head TA
