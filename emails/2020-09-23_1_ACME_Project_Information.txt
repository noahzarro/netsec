Dear students

At the beginning of today's exercise session, I will introduce the first graded semester project, which is about the ACME protocol. The (few) slides that I will use for introduction are available on our GitLab [1].

However, you are already equipped with everything you need to start working on the project.
The project description outlining the expected deliverables and the grading environment is available on GitLab as well [2].
Moreover, a personal repository with a code skeleton has been initialized for you at [3]. In case you registered for the course very recently, there may not be a repository for you yet and you may need to wait until the end of the week until it becomes available.

Note that the last commit to this repository (before 6 November, 23:59:00) will determine your project grade, which makes up 10% of your course grade. If you decide not to do the project, you will be awarded a project grade of 1.0, which allows a maximum grade of 5.0 for the course (If you do not register for the exam, your project grade will not show up in your transcript of records.)

In case you encounter questions and problems during the project phase, please use the GitLab issues [4].

Have fun with the project & best regards,
Simon
