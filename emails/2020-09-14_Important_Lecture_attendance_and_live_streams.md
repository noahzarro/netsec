[Network Security] Important: Lecture attendance and live streams

Dear students

This email contains additional information about attending Network Security lectures.

Because of the reduced lecture room capacity this semester, we have designed a system of "lecture tickets" for the Network Security lecture.
Concretely, this means that in order to visit a Network Security lecture, you _must_ first register online and obtain a seat confirmation [1].

Hence, if you want to attend tomorrow's Network Security lecture in person, you _must_ request a seat by giving a thumbs up to the following GitLab issue:

   https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-issues/-/issues/8

You should then be informed about your assigned seat within 10 minutes [2]. Note that if this is the first time you log on to the D-INFK GitLab, it may take up to an hour before you are granted access to the course materials [3]. For tomorrow's lecture there are currently about 40 seats still available, which will be further allocated on a first-come first-serve basis. For a full explanation of how the seat reservation system works, see https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PRV-PERRIG/netsec-course/netsec-2020-resources#lecture-tickets.

In case you cannot or do not want to attend the lecture in person, you will be able to follow a livestream of the lecture on https://video.ethz.ch/live/lectures/zentrum/chn/chn-c-14.html. In order to ask questions during the livestream you can (anonymously) use https://course.netsec.inf.ethz.ch/questions. Lecture recordings will also be made available through the ETH video portal.

Kind regards
Piet De Vaere, your NetSec head TA


[1] This only holds for lectures. The exercise room is large enough so that we do not need a reservation mechanism. 
[2] There was a bug in the seat assignment script that caused some people to not receive their seat reservations. This should now be resolved. If you requested a seat but did not yet receive an email confirmation, please let me know.
[3] It may also take up to four hours after registering for the course on myStudies before you are granted access to the GitLab course materials.
